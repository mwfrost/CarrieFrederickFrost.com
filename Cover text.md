I am a domestic theologian, trustee, Montessorian, Orthodox Christian, and mother of five living in Charlottesville, Virginia. The focus of my academic work as a PhD student in the Religious Studies Department at the University of Virginia is theology and family, especially the development of a theological understanding of motherhood.
